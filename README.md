Hello, I'm Colin Schulte. </br>
I've been fascinated with technology since I was a child and in 2017 I was given a life changing opportunity to learn coding through LaunchCode. </br>
I graduated in May 2021 and am currently looking for a job in the tech space. </br>
Currently teaching myself game development in Unity as a personal project. </br>
I can be reached at colingschulte@gmail.com </br>
