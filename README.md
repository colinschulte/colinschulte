Hello, I'm Colin Schulte. </br>
I've been fascinated with technology since I was a child and in 2017 I was given a life changing opportunity to learn coding through LaunchCode. </br>
I graduated in with an Associate's Degree in 2021 and worked as a DevSecOps Analyst for Boeing from Feb 2022-April 2023.</br>
I am currently searching for the next chapter in my coding journey. </br>
Teaching myself game development in Unity as a personal project. </br>
I can be reached at colingschulte@gmail.com
